Notes on implementing request process for DER dispatch/statuses utilizing DERMSMaster station as endpoint

1. I modified dispatch and statuses with newest wsdls.
2. cd git/opendms/DER
3. mvn clean generate-sources package
4. copy target/DERConnect.war $TOMCAT/webapps
5. start tomcat (derp)

I had an issue with mysql. Since this was to run on windows, had to create an 'epri'@'10.3.253.1'.... perms for mysql

6. open soapui file : git/opendms/DER/soapui/DER-Request-soapui-project.xml

Note: the DERMSMaster only accepts connections from soapui running on the same machine, ie: only localhost works

7. DER-Request / cimDERGroupRequest_ServerSoap TestSuite / createDERGroupDispatch TestCase / createDERGroupDispatch Win

Note : quick explanation on the flow of the request :

  1. the url for 'createDERGroupDispatch Win' points to OUR DER server request service
  2. <requestURL> points to the DERMSMaster 'dispatch' service
  3. DERMSmaster replies to our service
  4. our service sends the message back to soapUI

Note : currently DERMSmaster is not setting header/noun, which is causing our service to break,
       as noun is required in header.

8. DER-Request / cimDERGroupRequest_ServerSoap TestSuite / getDERGroupStatuses TestCase / getDERGroupStaatuses Win

ADDENDUM : Round trip testing without DERMSmaster (using only our services)

1. DER-Request / cimDERGroupRequest_ServerSoap TestSuite / createDERGroupDispatch TestCase / createDERGroupDispatch

Note : the <requestURL> points to our server. The flow is thus this :
  1. the url points to OUR Der server request service
  2. <requestURL> points to our version of createDERGroupDispatch
  3. createDERGroupDispatch replies to our request service
  4. our request service sends (3) back to soap ui

8. DER-Request / cimDERGroupRequest_ServerSoap TestSuite / getDERGroupStatuses TestCase / getDERGroupStaatuses

Note : works the same as (1) above
