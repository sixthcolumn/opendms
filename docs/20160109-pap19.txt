quick instructions for testing the pap19 methods

1. build as part of DER. mvn clean package
2. src files :

git/opendms/Der :
  src/main/java/com/sixthc/server/ws/CreateDemandresponseDeploymentImpl.java
  src/main/java/com/sixthc/server/ws/CreateDemandresponseDeploymentResponseImpl.java
  src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring/pap.xml (deployment CreateDemandresponseDeploymentImpl.java)
  src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring/pap2.xml (deployment CreateDemandresponseDeploymentResponseImpl.java)
  src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/cxf/context.xml (modified, added pap.xml and pap2.xml)

3. soap ui files :

git/opendms/Der/soapui/PAP-Receive-DemandResponseDeployment-soapui-project.xml
git/opendms/Der/soapui/PAP-Execute-DemandResponseDeployment-soapui-project.xml


4. execute sql script

git/opendms/scripts/sql/add_PAP.sql (for user epri, not wms, EPRI!)

4. TESTING :

a. open soap ui projects
b. set endpoints (should already be set)
   http://localhost:8080/DERConnect/pap/createDemandResponseDeploymentResponse (PAP-Receive)
   http://localhost:8080/DERConnect/pap/createDemandResponseDeployment (PAP-Execute)

Run the soapui messages. Should log to epri correctly.

Note: I did not do request for these messages. Let me know if you want that.
